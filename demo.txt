what is a lorem ipsum?
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. 
Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. 
Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.

The Lorem ipsum text is derived from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of Cicero's De finibus bonorum et malorum.
[6][7] The physical source may have been the 1914 Loeb Classical Library edition of De finibus, where the Latin text, presented on the left-hand (even) pages, breaks off on page 34 with 
"Neque porro quisquam est qui do-" and continues on page 36 with "lorem ipsum ...," suggesting that the galley type of that page was mixed up to make the dummy text seen today.[1]
The discovery of the text's origin is attributed to Richard McClintock, a Latin scholar at Hampdenâ€“Sydney College. McClintock connected Lorem ipsum to Cicero's writing sometime 
before 1982 while searching for instances of the Latin word consectetur, which was rarely used in classical literature.
[2] McClintock first published his discovery in a 1994 letter to a Before & After magazine editor,
[8] contesting the editor's earlier claim that Lorem ipsum had no meaning

Simply put, loremipsum is dummy text that occupies the space where the real content should be.
If you are designing an online business such as a blog and you do not have content already, 
you use a lorem ipsum generator to create placeholder or dummy text to show you how the business will look once you add the real content.
